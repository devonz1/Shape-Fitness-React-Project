 #  React Shape Fitness Company Portal System

#  INTRODUCTION
   
This Project Was done with React functional components
its an employee portal with CRUD operations I used a mock api. 
It keeps track of Each Employee by Name and The employees
Title ie Manager ,Supervisor etc. Once the employee inputs their
information the page automatically navigates to the read page
where the employee user can see their info dispalyed .I also added 
delete and update buttons that the employee can use to update their information.
Any information that is updated or deleted  in the portal will update 
on the api.
